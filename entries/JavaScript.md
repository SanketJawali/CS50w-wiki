# JavaScript
---
## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for enhancing web pages to provide an interactive experience to users. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables developers to implement complex features on web pages.



## History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript is not directly related to Java; the name was chosen for marketing reasons. The language has evolved significantly over the years, with the introduction of ECMAScript standards, the latest being ECMAScript 2021.



## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for more flexibility in coding.

- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript supports event-driven programming, enabling developers to write code that responds to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript provides support for asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax, allowing for non-blocking operations.

- **Prototype-Based**: JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

- **Wide Ecosystem**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Node.js, enabling developers to build everything from interactive web applications to server-side applications.
