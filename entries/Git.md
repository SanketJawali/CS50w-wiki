# Git

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, managing changes and maintaining a history of modifications in a repository.

## History
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for developing the Linux kernel. Before Git, the Linux project used BitKeeper, but when the relationship between the Linux community and BitKeeper ended, Torvalds created Git to provide a fast, efficient, and distributed version control system.

## Key Features
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows developers to create branches for independent development. These branches can later be merged, making it easier to manage feature development and bug fixes.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Each developer's working copy of the code is a full-fledged repository, including the complete history of changes.
- **Staging Area**: Git uses a staging area to allow developers to organize changes before committing them to the repository.
- **Version History**: Git tracks all changes made to a project, allowing developers to roll back to previous versions if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Git enables developers to collaborate on projects through services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, which provide remote repository hosting and collaboration tools.
