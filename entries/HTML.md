## Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It forms the structure of a webpage and is often complemented by CSS and JavaScript to style and add functionality to websites. HTML is written in the form of elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.

## History
HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It was initially a simple language designed for sharing documents between scientists. Over the years, it has evolved through several versions, with HTML4 being standardized in 1997, XHTML in 2000, and HTML5, the current version, being finalized in 2014.

## Key Features
- **Elements and Tags**: HTML documents are made up of elements represented by tags such as `<p>`, `<div>`, `<a>`, etc.
- **Hyperlinks**: HTML supports linking between documents via `<a>` tags.
- **Multimedia Support**: HTML5 introduced native support for audio, video, and scalable vector graphics (SVG).
- **Forms**: HTML includes elements like `<input>`, `<form>`, and `<button>` to create user input forms.
- **Semantics**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` to make webpages more meaningful.
