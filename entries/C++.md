# C++
---
## Introduction

C++ is a high-level programming language that extends the C programming language with object-oriented features. It is widely used for system/software development, game programming, and in performance-critical applications due to its efficiency and control over system resources. C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.



## History

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s as an enhancement to the C language. It was initially called "C with Classes," reflecting its focus on object-oriented programming. The first commercial release was in 1985, and the language has since undergone several revisions, with the most significant standards being C++98, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.



## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: C++ supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for the creation of modular and reusable code.

- **Performance and Efficiency**: C++ allows for low-level memory manipulation, enabling developers to optimize performance for resource-intensive applications.

- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: C++ includes the STL, a powerful library that provides a collection of algorithms and data structures such as vectors, lists, and maps.

- **Operator Overloading**: C++ allows developers to define custom behavior for operators, enabling intuitive use of user-defined types.

- **Compatibility with C**: C++ is largely compatible with C, allowing for the integration of existing C code and libraries.
