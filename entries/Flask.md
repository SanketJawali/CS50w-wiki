# Flask
---
## Introduction

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, designed to make web development easy and straightforward. It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and is built on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Flask is often referred to as a "micro" framework because it provides the essentials needed to build a web application without imposing a specific project structure or dependencies.



## History

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher in 2010 as a simple framework for building web applications. It emerged from the need for a more minimalistic and flexible alternative to more full-featured frameworks like Django. Over the years, Flask has gained significant popularity due to its ease of use, extensive documentation, and a thriving ecosystem of extensions.



## Key Features

- **Lightweight and Modular**: Flask allows developers to choose the components they want to use, enabling a modular approach to web development.

- **Built-in Development Server**: Flask includes a built-in development server, making it easy to test applications locally during development.

- **Templating Engine**: Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, allowing developers to create dynamic HTML pages by embedding Python code.

- **RESTful Request Dispatching**: Flask makes it easy to create RESTful APIs, allowing developers to handle various HTTP methods with minimal configuration.

- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions that add functionality, such as authentication, database integration, and form handling, allowing developers to enhance their applications easily.
