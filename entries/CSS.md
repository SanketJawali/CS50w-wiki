## Introduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It is responsible for the visual layout, design, and formatting of a webpage, making the user interface more attractive and easier to navigate.

## History
CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 and was officially released as CSS1 in 1996. It became widely used alongside HTML to separate the content from its presentation. Over time, CSS2 was introduced in 1998, and CSS3, which includes modular extensions and new features, was released starting in 1999 and continues to evolve.

## Key Features
- **Selectors**: CSS allows developers to target specific HTML elements using various selectors such as classes, IDs, and element names.
- **Box Model**: CSS uses a box model to define margins, padding, and borders for elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries enable CSS to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: These modern layout models provide powerful tools for positioning and aligning elements in complex, responsive designs.
- **Animations**: CSS supports transitions and keyframe-based animations to create dynamic visual effects.
