# Django
---
## Introduction
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, providing tools for developers to build robust web applications efficiently.

## History
Django was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while working at a local newspaper. It was open-sourced in 2005 and quickly gained popularity due to its emphasis on reusable components, scalability, and its “batteries-included” philosophy. The Django Software Foundation (DSF) was established to maintain its development.

## Key Features
- **Admin Interface**: Django comes with a built-in, customizable admin panel for managing data models.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django provides an ORM system that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code instead of SQL.
- **Template System**: Django uses a templating engine to separate presentation logic from business logic.
- **Security Features**: Django includes built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Scalability**: Django is designed to handle high traffic loads and is used by large websites like Instagram and Pinterest.
