# C
---
## Introduction
C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that has had a significant impact on modern computing. Developed in the early 1970s, C is known for its efficiency, control over system resources, and the ability to interact closely with hardware. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development.

## History
C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972 as an evolution of the B programming language. It was initially developed to implement the Unix operating system, which contributed to its widespread adoption. The first edition of the C programming language was published in 1978, and it has undergone several revisions, with ANSI C (C89) and ISO C (C99 and C11) being the most notable standards.

## Key Features

- **Efficiency**: C provides low-level access to memory and system resources, allowing for high-performance applications.

- **Portability**: C code can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes, making it highly portable.

- **Structured Programming**: C supports structured programming principles, promoting organized and maintainable code through functions and control structures.

- **Rich Standard Library**: C includes a robust standard library that provides a wide range of functions for handling input/output, string manipulation, and mathematical computations.

- **Pointer Arithmetic**: C allows direct manipulation of memory through pointers, enabling powerful programming techniques but also requiring careful management to avoid errors.
